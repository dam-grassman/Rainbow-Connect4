# Rainbow-Connect4

DQN & extensions applied to the game Connect4
based on the paper *Rainbow : Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning*, DeepMind 


All the credits for the Rainbow part goes to this repository https://github.com/Kaixhin/Rainbow/. I only created a gym-like environment for a Connect4 game in order to replace Atari games originally used in the Rainbow article. A few modifications from the orginal github were needed though.

Using ```--render ``` flag during evaluation/training, one can see the agent (red) play against a simple AI (green).
